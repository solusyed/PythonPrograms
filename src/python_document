PYTON:
    Python is an interpreted, ObjectOriented programing language developed by
"GUIDO VAN ROSSUM" in 1991. Python interpreted is dynamic and multipurpose programming language,
because it can be used in 3d,CAD etc. When compare to many programing languages python is easy to learn.
while compare to other programing languages python is free of cost (open source).

Python Applications:
1) 3D cad applications
2) Audio (or) video based applications
3) Web Enterprisers

In python, we have a different data type and operators.
     Python we have different data types:
      1) Premitive data type
      2) Non-premitive data type

 Premitive data types:
           premitive data type is defined as the data types which was already built
in the programming languages.
  Example:
          i)Integer-int(numerical values,not decimal values)
         ii)String-str(collection of different characters)
        iii)Float -float(decimal values of integer)
         iv)Boolean -bool(true or false statements)

NON-premitive data types:
               is defined as the data types which place with multiple premitive data types.
  Example:
         i)List
        ii)Set
       iii)Tuple
        iv)Dictionary

Python operators:
 in python, operators are used to perform the operations with different data(data types) in programming languages.
       a)Arthimetaic operator - (add, sub, multiplication, division, modulus, floordivision)
       b)Assignment operator  - (=, +=,-=,*=,/=)
       c)Relational operator  - (<,>,==,<=,>=,!=)
       d)unary operator       -
       e)logic operator	   - (and,or,not)
